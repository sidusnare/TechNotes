Clear GPT:
gdisk /dev/sdX
It will prompt you to select the partition:

Found valid MBR and GPT. Which do you want to use?
 1 - MBR
  2 - GPT
   3 - Create blank GPT

   Select the GPT one. In my case, 2. Use the ? command to print the command
   list. Enter x for expert options, then z to zap the GPT table and all the
   data on the disc:

   Command (? for help): x 

   Expert command (? for help): z
   About to wipe out GPT on /dev/sdx. Proceed? (Y/N): y
   GPT data structures destroyed! You may now partition the disk using fdisk
   or
   other utilities.
   Blank out MBR? (Y/N): y
