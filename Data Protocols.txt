Connections over SSL require OpenSSL
Linux systems should allready have it installed, if not consult your package managment system.
Windows users can get it from http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html which is refrenced from http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html

FTP:
Ftp uses multiple ports fot xfering data, in passive mode its dynamic, in active mode its port 20. All you can do from telnet is auth and logout. If your on the commandlike try ftp. Also FTPS uses TLS and OpenSSL only will do TLS for you in SMTP and POP3, so just use command line FTP.
